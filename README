Toy implementation of Insanely Dependent Types

Features

  - Insane pi-types:

      [x1 : A1, x2 : A2, .., xn : An] -> B

    All xi are in scope in the Ai's (and in B of course). Applications of
    insane functions must be fully applied.

  - Everything is mutually recursive

  - Simple Agda-like syntax

Limitations

  - No implicit arguments
  - Function types and Set are not terms
  - No indexed datatypes
